# Project: Micro-Reddit

> In this project, we built the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. We used only the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.

1. Generate rails app
2. Generate your User model and fill out the migration to get the columns you want.
3. Run the migration 
4. Implement the user validations 
5. Set up User, Post and Comments associations
